Introduction
Very simple data visulization to show details of avg. temp for different years and if user is interested in learning more about the data in particular year show details of temp in months format for that particular year using Bar Chart, Calendar View and Line Chart. If user is still interested in learning more about data for particular day s/he can choose particular day to view details about it. We have used starter code mentioned in the references it does something similar but for different use case (https://github.com/g1eb/calendar-heatmap). We have modified it according to our use case and charts specifications. To sum up the idea we implemented is every use case flow can be converted into summary to granular data level flow and based on user’s interest s/he can control the view of data visualization. It’s particularly useful when user tries to seek information out of data on mobile devices.
